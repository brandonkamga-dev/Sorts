# Goal

Arrange the numbers in a desired order.

# Principle

1. Go through the list multiple times.
2. On each pass, compare each element with its neighbor and swap them if necessary.
3. After each pass, one element reaches its final position.
4. Repeat the process until the entire list is sorted.

# Complexity

* Worst case: O(n²)
* Average case: O(n²)
* Best case: O(n)
