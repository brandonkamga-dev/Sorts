# Goal

Arrange the numbers in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.

# Principle

1. Divide the array into a sorted part (initially empty) and an unsorted part (initially the whole array).
2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.
3. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
4. Expand the sorted part by one element and shrink the unsorted part.
5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

# Complexity

* Worst case: O(n²)
* Average case: O(n²)
* Best case: O(n²)
